Bramley is an open source radio contest management system. It is developed and maintained by [Hamjoint CIC](http://www.hamjoint.org/) for [Hamjoint Contests](https://www.hamjoint.com/contests).

Bramley is dependent on several components of the [Laravel framework](http://laravel.com), and supports [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management. Building a Bramley-based application requires some knowledge of PHP development.
